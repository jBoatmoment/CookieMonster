Note to testers:

Hi! 
We really hope you like our project!
Altough we weren't able to fully complete it due to time restrictions, we still got great work done!

Our original idwas was to create an extention that detects when a site uses cookies/malware and notify the user with a correct and relevant
notification. 
We were able to build most, however we couldn't finish the notification system in time.

To test the tool, we suggest to go to Chrome dev tools and allow all third party cookies. while on site, you should be able to see the cookies being detected in the console/application tab. Some aspects of cookie detection is still unfinsished, but can still be tested via dev tools using the allow third party cookies options as mentioed above.


For future updates/additions (apart from making sure we finish the project in time), we could add more detection of malware, as well as user defined detection
meaning the tool will track if the site uses certain items/elements the user defines and wants to check.
We actually were able to do this on a copy of the prpject, however decided not to submit it since it led to some bugs we could not solve in time. 
Therefore, this version is our latest and most stable version of the project so far.

We want to thank you for the opprtunity to create a meaninful product and learn! 
We look forward to hearing results from you!
All the best ane keep coding!
